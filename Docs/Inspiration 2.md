# Main Inspiration

The game itself is an extension of an [older game](https://studio.code.org/projects/gamelab/tRpAJ_Y1-DKwFg7Lvu9Jdw012YJZJRhR1q929SxkbWs) 
created in code.org (circa December 2022). It is meant to be an extension of this 
game, as the original was created in High School.

# Inspiration: *Sekrio: Shadows Die Twice*

Other inspiration is that of Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice, where the core gameplay 
revolves around a "posture" meter which degrades and a character takes damage,
which once full allows for the player to perform a finisher. 

Higher-tier enemies, notably bosses, feature not only a health bar, but a few dots
below their health bar; their posture only slowly builds up, but will build up 
faster if you lower their health. The only way to beat these enemies is to deplete
the red dots, which are counters for the number of finishers.

Say, for example, you have a boss with a full health bar and two red dots. This means
that the boss will slowly build posture unless you lower their health enough. Once 
their posture is maxed out, they will enter a staggered state, in which they will
become immobile and briefly give you a window of opportunity to perform a finisher,
which is simply performing an attack context action up next to them to play a fancy
animation. This finisher will remove a dot, you have now progressed in the boss fight,
but the boss will restore their health bar. Rinse and repeat until you perform
a second finisher on the boss, which will remove the second dot and now the boss
is dead.

# Inspiration: *Smash Bros*

Other inspiration is that of Smash Bros, specifically the 2D arena fighter theme, 
where players fight on a 2D screen with platforms.
